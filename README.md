Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
📌 Overview

This project analyzes Twitter data to classify tweets into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.
It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models to understand public opinion and social media trends.

⚙️ Features

Preprocess tweets (stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, tokenization).

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on tweet datasets.

Vectorize text using TF-IDF / Word2Vec.

Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Visualize results with word clouds, bar plots, and confusion matrix.

Can be extended to real-time sentiment detection via Twitter API.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NLTK / spaCy – Text preprocessing

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

Pandas / NumPy – Data manipulation

Example Output

Input Tweet: “I love this new phone! It’s amazing.” → Positive

Input Tweet: “This service is terrible. Very disappointed.” → Negative

Input Tweet: “The weather is okay today.” → Neutral

🔮 Future Enhancements

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit/Flask.

Integrate with Twitter API for real-time sentiment tracking.

Use Deep Learning (LSTM / Transformers like BERT) for better accuracy.
